# ☯️ Feng Shui

## Feng Shui Overview
Feng shui (_Chinese: 風水_) is a pseudoscientific traditional practice originating from ancient China, which claims to use energy forces to harmonize individuals with their surrounding environment. The term feng shui literally translates as "wind-water" in English. This is a cultural shorthand taken from the passage of the now-lost Book of Burial.
